## Problem: How to start a School or University General Student Robotics course when there are only a few Robotics/Machine Learning Educators?

## Solution:

1. Awesome generalist Educator needed
2. Computer Lab with a few 3D printers 
3. Great IT support for changing software installation
4. Starting robotics lab full of Sensors, Actuators, IoT modules, basic electronics (wires, breadboards, resistors, capacitors ...), soldering equipment etc. ~ $2,000 -$10,000 
5. Budget for expendables and a class set of new microcontrollers every few years. ~ $500 - $3,000
6. You need an encredible, student do-able Robotics Machine learning IoT communication curriculum

## Concept:   
Robotics is all about technology problem solving. The student's need to solve the technology problems. As soon as all the issues are solved, and there are no more problems, is it really a Robotics Curriculum?


## Why:

LLM's like ChatGPT, coPilot, BingChat, LLAMA-v2 are dramatically changing all aspects of life including education, but all this Artificial Intelligence and the datasets they are trained on are nearly impossible to teach the general public, but tinyML using inexpensive microcontrollers like Arduinos allow all students a window into understanding all forms of AI, by allowing all students to train a simplified version of Machine Learning using a much reduced dataset with data such as images that the students generate themselves. 

This is reasonably easy to teach with a Robotics, Machine learning IoT course, giving students an intuitive understanding of the technology that is changing all aspects of our lives.

## Problem: 
How can a School or University start a general Robotics course for students when there are only a few educators skilled in Robotics and Machine Learning?

## Solution:

1. **A versatile, passionate educator**
2. **A computer lab** equipped with a few 3D printers
3. **Strong IT support** to manage software installations and updates
4. **An initial robotics lab** stocked with sensors, actuators, IoT modules, basic electronics (wires, breadboards, resistors, capacitors, etc.), soldering equipment, etc. ~ $2,000 - $10,000 
5. **A budget for consumables** and a set of new microcontrollers every few years. ~ $500 - $3,000
6. **A well-crafted, student-friendly Robotics, Machine Learning, and IoT curriculum**

## Concept:   
Robotics is fundamentally about solving technology problems. Students must actively engage in overcoming these challenges. Once all problems are solved and there are no more challenges to face, can it truly be called a Robotics Curriculum?

## Why:
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, coPilot, BingChat, and LLAMA-v2 are revolutionizing various aspects of life, including education. However, the complexity of AI and the datasets these models are trained on makes them difficult to teach to the general public. TinyML, using affordable microcontrollers like Arduinos, offers students a hands-on way to grasp AI concepts. It allows them to train a simplified version of Machine Learning using small, manageable datasetsâ€”such as images they create themselves.

This approach is relatively easy to teach within a Robotics, Machine Learning, and IoT course, providing students with an intuitive understanding of the technology that is rapidly transforming our world.
