## Problem: How to start a School or University General Student Robotics course when there are only a few Robotics/Machine Learning Educators?

## Solution:

1. Awesome generalist Educator needed
2. Computer Lab with a few 3D printers 
3. Great IT support for changing software installation
4. Starting robotics lab full of Sensors, Actuators, IoT modules, basic electronics (wires, breadboards, resistors, capacitors ...), soldering equipment etc. ~ $2,000 -$10,000 
5. Budget for expendables and a class set of new microcontrollers every few years. ~ $500 - $3,000
6. You need an encredible, student do-able Robotics Machine learning IoT communication curriculum

## Concept:   
Robotics is all about technology problem solving. The student's need to solve the technology problems. As soon as all the issues are solved, and there are no more problems, is it really a Robotics Curriculum?
